### Hypothesis 0: Cryptocurrencies Are Not a Separate Asset Class
...but represent a hyper-digital and legally unconstrained version of traditional financial instruments. If you would completely strip a cryptocurrency down to its bare essence, you would find it is simply an integer whose meaning is enforced by a network (the blockchain).

### Hypothesis 1: Different Cryptocurrencies Belong to Different Asset Classes
...which is why I prefer to call them tokens. In most cases they were never actually meant to be currencies. Of the major tokens only Bitcoin was explicitly designed to be a currency. Ether, for example, is primarily meant as fuel for a network, so why should it not be considered a commodity, like oil? Let's take the classic list of asset classes (stocks, fixed income, cash, foreign currencies, real estate, commodities) and categorise some of our favourite tokens.

**Stocks**:
* Defining characteristic(s):

  Represent shares of __ownership__ (I'm going to handily forget about the "publicly traded", which is a semantic artifact of old finance)

* Tokens of relevance:
  * Lykke:

    These tokens *actually* represent ownership according to the token issuer's own terms. Holding them entitles you to attendance of shareholder meetings, voting etc.

**Commodities**:
* Defining characteristic(s):
  Have __utility__ (I'm going to handily forget about the "physical goods", which again is an artifact of the pre-digital era)
* Tokens of relevance:
  * Ether (ETH/ETC):








Given that cryptocurrencies are dispersed across multiple asset classes, they may paradoxically present potential for diversification amongst themselves in asset allocation strategy.
