### Hypothesis 0: Cryptocurrencies Are Not a Separate Asset Class
...but represent a hyper-digital and legally unconstrained version of traditional financial instruments (assuming they're tradeable *name exceptions??*). If you would completely strip a cryptocurrency down to its bare essence, you would find it is simply an integer/float whose meaning is enforced by a network (the blockchain). You could come up with a thousand and one uses for them, and people currently are. *Most of the time projects will purpose their integers as some kind of network token.*

### Hypothesis 1: Different Cryptocurrencies Belong to Different Asset Classes
...which is why I prefer to call them tokens. In most cases they were never actually meant to be currencies. Of the major tokens only Bitcoin was explicitly designed to be a currency. Ether, for example, is primarily meant as fuel for a network, so why should it not be considered a commodity, like oil? Let's take the classic list of asset classes (stocks, fixed income, cash, foreign currencies, real estate, commodities) and categorise some of our favourite tokens.

TBD:
XRP used as bridge currency and for anti-spam (utility),
STR,
PLU,
MLN
ZEC
Dash
DOGE
DGD
NMR
TKN

**Stocks**:
* Defining characteristic(s):

  Represent shares of __ownership__ (I'm going to handily forget about the "publicly traded", which is a semantic artifact of old finance)

* Tokens of relevance:
  * Lykke:

    These tokens *actually* represent ownership according to the token issuer's own terms. Holding them entitles you to attendance of shareholder meetings, voting etc.

**Commodities**:
* Defining characteristic(s):
  Have (non-monetary *need to explain this distinction better*) __utility__ (I'm going to handily forget about the "physical goods", which again is an artifact of the pre-digital era)

* Tokens of relevance:
  * Ether (ETH/ETC):
    Allows you to send transactions, most importantly to smart contracts executing human-independent code (miner fee + gas as anti-spam).

  * Factoids:
    Give you the right to write to the Factom network.

  * Basic Attention Token:
    blablabla.

  * Augur:
    blablabla.

  * Storj:
    blablabla.

  * Et cetera: GNT, ANT, SNT


  * For any one of these tokens, if you're interested in the network they are associated with, they'll have utility to you. Ergo, within financial theory, they're commodities.

**Foreign Currencies**:
* Defining characteristic(s):
  Used as a __Medium of exchange__.

* Tokens of relevance:
  * Bitcoin
  * *Ripples
    This one may be somewhat controversial, because you could also argue it is a utility token, making it a commodity - hybrid??*

**Fixed income**
*tokens that earn some kind of interest, don't necessarily have to return principal if they pay interest to perpetuity; ICN? *

**Cash**
Not particularly relevant as long as physical bitcoins etc are not commonly accepted

**Real estate**
* Tokens of relevance:
  * REX?
  * IoT tokens that provide direct ownership of an item?

### Hypothesis 2: Commodity Tokens can be Valued Similarly to Traditional Commodities


### Hypothesis 3: As Token Markets Mature, Diversification Across Tokens in Different Asset Classes Could Become as Efficient as Traditional Asset Allocation Strategies
...i.e. you can combine Bitcoin, Ether and Lykke like you would combine normal Stocks, Currencies and Commodities in a portfolio and expect diversification benefits.

Given that cryptocurrencies are dispersed across multiple asset classes, they may paradoxically present potential for diversification amongst themselves in asset allocation strategy.
