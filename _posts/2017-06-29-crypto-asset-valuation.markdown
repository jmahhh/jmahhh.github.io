### Hypothesis 1: Cryptocurrencies Are Not a Separate Asset Class
...but represent a hyper-digital and legally unconstrained version of traditional financial instruments (assuming they're tradeable *name exceptions??*). If you would completely strip a cryptocurrency down to its bare essence, you would find it is simply an integer/float whose meaning is enforced by a network (the blockchain). You could come up with a thousand and one uses for them, and people currently are. *Most of the time projects will purpose their integers as some kind of network token.*

### Hypothesis 2: Different Cryptocurrencies Belong to Different Asset Classes
...which is why I prefer to call them tokens. In most cases they were never actually meant to be currencies. Of the major tokens only Bitcoin was explicitly designed to be a currency. Ether, for example, is primarily meant as fuel for a network, so why should it not be considered a commodity, like oil? Let's take the classic list of asset classes (stocks, fixed income, cash, foreign currencies, real estate, commodities) and categorise some of our favourite tokens.

TBD:
XRP used as bridge currency and for anti-spam (utility),
STR,
PLU,
MLN
ZEC
Dash
DOGE
DGD
NMR
TKN

**Stocks**:
* Defining characteristic(s):

  Represent shares of __ownership__ (I'm going to handily forget about the "publicly traded", which is a semantic artifact of old finance)

* Tokens of relevance:
  * Lykke:

    These tokens *actually* represent ownership according to the token issuer's own terms. Holding them entitles you to attendance of shareholder meetings, voting etc.

**Commodities**:
* Defining characteristic(s):
  Have (non-monetary *need to explain this distinction better*) __utility__ (I'm going to handily forget about the "physical goods", which again is an artifact of the pre-digital era)

* Tokens of relevance:
  * Ether (ETH/ETC):
    Allows you to send transactions, most importantly to smart contracts executing human-independent code (miner fee + gas as anti-spam).

  * Factoids:
    Give you the right to write to the Factom network.

  * Basic Attention Token:
    blablabla.

  * Augur:
    blablabla.

  * Storj:
    blablabla.

  * Et cetera: GNT, ANT, SNT


  * For any one of these tokens, if you're interested in the network they are associated with, they'll have utility to you. Ergo, within financial theory, they're commodities.

**Foreign Currencies**:
* Defining characteristic(s):
  Used as a __Medium of exchange__.

* Tokens of relevance:
  * Bitcoin
  * *Ripples
    This one may be somewhat controversial, because you could also argue it is a utility token, making it a commodity - hybrid??*

**Fixed income**
*tokens that earn some kind of interest, don't necessarily have to return principal if they pay interest to perpetuity; ICN? *

**Cash**
Not particularly relevant as long as physical bitcoins etc are not commonly accepted

**Real estate**
* Tokens of relevance:
  * REX?
  * IoT tokens that provide direct ownership of an item?

### Hypothesis 3: Commodity Tokens can be Valued Similarly to Traditional Commodities
Simple demand and supply. May warrant some pundit's obsessions with the supply of e.g. ETH ([compare with ETC monetary policy][ETCstatement]). Demand is a lot trickier to measure. Demand is classicly based on previous demand (plus macro?). How do we measure demand for e.g. ETH? We have to look at existing projects, their needs and their potential growth as well as appearance of new projects. Thought experiment: ETH not traded on exchanges. Those needing Ether can get it by doing OTC with the Foundation *not sure this makes sense as normal users wanting to interact must also do that*. Startups will need to estimate core amount + tx fees (latter requires anticipating network status i.e. miner behavior etc) ------> RESEARCH: how much Ether does a token startup use a month? Test networks some (most) of the need.

Ironically most of the demand for Ether comes from its use as a currency to buy ICOs at the moment (medium of exchange).

Interaction of supply demand right before (pump) and after (dump) an ICO.

Core element: gas (for simple txns or contract interaction)
--> estimate simple txns
--> estimate contract interactions

### Hypothesis 4: As Token Markets Mature, Diversification Across Tokens in Different Asset Classes Could Become as Efficient as Traditional Asset Allocation Strategies
...i.e. you can combine Bitcoin, Ether and Lykke like you would combine normal Stocks, Currencies and Commodities in a portfolio and expect diversification benefits.

Given that cryptocurrencies are dispersed across multiple asset classes, they may paradoxically present potential for diversification amongst themselves in asset allocation strategy.
